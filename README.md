<a href="https://github.com/orgs/Electrostat-Lab/repositories?language=&q=electrostat-lab&sort=&type=all"> <img src = "https://img.shields.io/badge/projects-null?style=flat&label=Electrostat-Lab&color=%235555AA" /> </a>

This repository provides a contribution depot for the **_Future Minds Initiative by [Dr. Hazem Ali](https://github.com/drhazemali)_** by picking up the fine grains from the Electrostat-Lab and the Electrostatic-Sandbox SDK project hosted and maintained by [Pavly G.](https://github.com/pavly-gerges).

> [!NOTE]
> **Disclaimer of knowledge**: Subjects covered here are some way unique topics that are rarely approached from the
> practical computer engineering perspective; therefore it's contemplated that this repository
> will attain a particular target of covering these topics in an applied theoretical environment (i.e., theoretical and practical);
> thus, software engineering and arithmetics basics in addition to knowing a programming language (preferably C/C++ or Java)
> are prerequisites to fully absorb the knowledge that will be presented here.

Essentially, the following will be the initial topics that the contribution depot will provide: 
## Series Title: "An introduction to Applied Computation":
- [Guidelines: A curricular computational model derived from the ACM Guidelines for CS Education](https://github.com/Electrostat-Lab/Future-Minds-Contributions/blob/master/curricular-computational-model/cc-model.md)
- Mathematics: An approach to Discrete Mathematics and Software design paradigms.
- Theory of computation: Approaching the Theory of computation (i.e., Automata theory, Computational complexity theory, and Computability theory).
- Theory of computation: A practical approach to the theory of computation (a coding project on the Electrostatic-Sandbox SDK).
- Software Engineering: An approach to utilizing software design paradigms in designing data structures and algorithms analysis.
- Advanced Embedded Systems: Computer organization, Flip-flops (D-latches and JK-latches), and state-machines (?).
- Advanced Embedded Systems: A Deep dive into Low-level state-machines, and applied Computing methods (?).

## Series Title: "A workshop for basics of software engineering using the Electrostatic-Sandbox SDK":
- Guidelines: NASA and Google coding Guidelines for C/C++ and safety-critical systems.
- Mathematics: Using the Automata Models and the [System-Entity-Structure (SES) Framework by Pawletta et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3108244.3108245), previously described, to model the software before coding it.
- Software Building: A live workshop for understanding the building and the production lifecycle of software using CMake, Bash, and GitHub packages.
- Software Engineering: Writing software C libraries on GNU/Linux, and writing unit tests (e.g., Automata framework, Entity-Component System Framework, Thread Models for thread controls, ...etc).

## Advanced Scientific and Engineering workshops: "Complex Systems Analysis, Cybernetics and Safety-critical systems":
- The Therac-25 Catastrophes.
- The Air France Flight 447 Catastrophic failure.
- The Deepwater Horizon Catastrophic failure.
