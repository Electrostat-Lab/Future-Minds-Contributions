# Future-Minds-Contributions

This repository provides a contribution depot for the _Future Minds Initiative by [Dr. Hazem Ali](https://github.com/drhazemali)_ by picking up fine grains from the Electrostat-Lab and the Electrostatic-Sandbox SDK project managed by [Pavly G.](https://github.com/pavly-gerges).

Essentially, the following will be the initial topics that the contribution depot will provide: 
## Series Title: "An introduction to Applied Computation":
- Guidelines: An introduction to the ACM Guidelines of Computing.
- Mathematics: An approach to Discrete Mathematics and Software design paradigms.
- Theory of computation: Approaching the Theory of computation (i.e., Automata theory, Computational complexity theory, and Computability theory).
- Theory of computation: A practical approach to the theory of computation (a coding project on the Electrostatic-Sandbox SDK).
- Software Engineering: An approach to utilizing software design paradigms in designing data structures and algorithms analysis.
- Advanced Embedded Systems: Computer organization, Flip-flops (D-latches and JK-latches), and state-machines (?).
- Advanced Embedded Systems: A Deep dive into Low-level state-machines, and applied Computing methods (?).

## Series Title: "A workshop for basics of software engineering using the Electrostatic-Sandbox SDK":
- Guidelines: NASA and Google coding Guidelines for C/C++ and safety-critical systems.
- Mathematics: Using the Automata Models previously described to model the software before coding it.
- Software Building: A live workshop for understanding the building and the production lifecycle of software using CMake, Bash, and GitHub packages.
- Software Engineering: Writing software C libraries on GNU/Linux, and writing unit tests (e.g., Automata framework, Entity-Component System Framework, Thread Models for thread controls, ...etc).
