## Preface and vision:
Essentially, the _cirrcular computational model_ is a community-driven intuition from the _Guidelines for Computer Science Education_ published by the _Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)_ on the _ACM Digital Library (ACM-DL)_ as a result of a joint work force among _ACM_, _IEEE-CS community_, and _the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)_. The intuition behind these huge organizations task force is to provide a **knowledge model (KM)** that displays a strong intermix among multiple disciplines by introducing **knowledge areas (KA)** that represents components composed of **knowledge units (KU)** and **learning outcomes**.

Consequently, the vision of this repository is to summarize the essential sections from the **CS-2023** and the **CE-2023** files, and introduce some useful resources to tackle down the essential topics from the presented **Knowledge Areas**.

## Outline of the model:
1) Knowledge Areas (Units and Learning Outcomes).
2) Applied Computation (Corresponding Competency Model).
3) Specializing Areas of knowledge.
